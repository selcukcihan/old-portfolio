about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Building (and deprecating) software is my passion.
  As a former Amazonian devoted to helping customers and solving problems, I bring a strong sense of ownership and a track record of delivering results.
  With over four years of experience developing serverless apps on AWS, I have a proven ability to take on technical duties from operations to development and architecture.
  I'm a certified AWS solutions architect, who has worked as part of globally distributed teams of engineers in the past few years.

  Comfortable taking on work in *any* tech stack, though Serverless, TypeScript and Python have been recurring themes in the past few years for me.
  There's also <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.selcukcihan.com">a personal blog</a> - in Turkish - which serves as a notepad for me; documenting problems, solutions and research about software development.
  For details, have a look at my <a href="/resume/selcukcihan.pdf" title="Resume">Curriculum Vitae</a> <small>(which may refer you to this page, in that case be conscious about the infinite loop you are in or you might never reach out to me!)</small>.
  You can also watch me introduce myself on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i1SwJb-D_8">youtube</a>.
