    * Developed and maintained the orchestration platform that processes Amazonâ€™s catalog updates. The platform is able to handle tens of thousands of TPS, enabling the finest and largest catalog on earth. Uses Kinesis as the backbone and routes updates to the catalog to relevant downstream services.
    * Added further functionality to a Node.js service which is a high TPS REST service for diff analysis.
    * Refactored an orchestration engine which consumes Kinesis and calls downstream services such that the application can be started without any dependencies, thus enabling performance testing of the core.
    * Supported the reconciliation engine (Java 8) that generates the retail catalog.
    * Carried out live migrations of several web services without downtime. Successfully deprecated multiple legacy services in an effort to simplify the overall architecture and enable catalog growth.
