## About

Building (and deprecating) software is my passion, with a focus on scalable backend services in the web ecosystem recently. You will find me most useful in crafting solutions, by putting customer first and ensuring operational excellence. Comfortable taking on work in any tech stack, though Java has been a recurring theme in the past few years for me. I hold BS &amp; MS degrees from <a href="http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr" target="_blank">the department of computer engineering, Bogazici University</a>. For details, have a look at my <a href="/resume/selcukcihan.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a> <small>(which may refer you to this page, in that case be conscious about the infinite loop you are in or you might never reach out to me!)</small>.
