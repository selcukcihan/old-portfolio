## About

I hold BS &amp; MS degrees from <a href="http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr" target="_blank">the department of computer engineering, Bogazici University</a>. While as an embedded software developer, I was involved in IPTV settop boxes, CANBUS network protocol and other cool/hackish stuff. In the recent years, I have been developing web and desktop applications. I like to code in c &amp; python. Love posix threads, hate exception handling (as opposed to returning/setting error values).
